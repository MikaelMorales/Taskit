# Taskit

We all would love to have more time. Taskit will allow you to save a lot !

Taskit is a **smart task manager** which will sort your tasks automatically to highlight the ones that are the most urgent and tell you where to start.

To do so you just need to enter the **due date** of the task, the estimated **duration** it will take you to complete it, and the **location** where you can work on it.

Whenever you need to schedule a task with friends, you can add them and contact them directly with Taskit to realize your dreams.

Taskit is here to make your life simpler.
